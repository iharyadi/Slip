# Slip
 It is an example of Arduino slip library to be used with Environments sensor.   
 
 For example on how to use it, please see my repository https://github.com/iharyadi/IRExample
 
 Note: Specific to Environment Sensor,  the absolute maximum packet size that can be sent is 32 byte with slip protocol assuming all bytes are one of the escape characters.  The total buffer for a slip packet is 64 bytes.
